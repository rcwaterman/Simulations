TODO:

1. Add a pygame window
    a. Make the window size dynamic (use a general purpose "scale" variable)
2. Draw a bounding box and a ball within it.
3. Add physics (gravity, coefficient of restitution, collision detection, change in direction, etc.)
4. Determine what to do upon collision (increase velocity, change ball color, trace ball motion, make sound, etc)
